# VisuAlgo
A web-based visualizer for Algorithms

## Overview

A web-based Visualizer for implementing and realizing:
1) Jarvis March and Kirk-Patrick Seidel Algorithms which constructs a Convex Hull given a set of two dimensional Points.
2) RNA folding algorithm which predicts the secondary structure of a given RNA sequence that dictates its physical and chemical properties.
